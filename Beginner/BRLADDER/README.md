Problem Code: **BRLADDER**

Bearland has infinitely many cities, numbered starting from 1. Some pairs of cities are connected with bidirectional roads:

- There are roads 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and so on (there is a road between cities 2\*i+1 and 2\*i+2 for every non-negative integer i).
- There are roads 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-9, ... (between every two consecutive odd numbers).
- There are roads 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, ... (between every two consecutive even numbers).

This is how the first few cities and roads between them look like:

You are given **Q** queries. In each query, for the given pair of different cities **a** and **b**, you should check if there is a road between them. For each query, print "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains an integer **_Q_**, denoting the number of queries.
- Each of the following **_Q_** lines contains two distinct integers **_a_** and **_b_**, denoting two cities in one query.

## Output

For each query, output a single line containing the answer â€” "YES" if there is a road between the given cities **_a_** and **_b_**, and "NO" otherwise (without the quotes).

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
7
1 4
4 3
5 4
10 12
1 3
999999999 1000000000
17 2384823
```
### Output:
```
NO
YES
NO
YES
YES
YES
NO
```
## Explanation

In the example test, the answer is "YES" for pairs (4, 3), (10, 12), (1, 3) and (999999999, 1000000000). Roads 3-4 and 1-3 you can see on the drawing in the statement.

The answer is "NO" for example for a pair (1, 4), because there is no road between cities 1 and 4.
