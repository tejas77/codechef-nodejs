# [Sums in a Triangle](https://www.codechef.com/problems/SUMTRIAN)
Problem Code: **SUMTRIAN**

Let's consider a triangle of numbers in which a number appears in the first line, two numbers appear in the second line, three in the third line, etc. Develop a program which will compute the largest of the sums of numbers that appear on the paths starting from the top towards the base, so that:

- on each path the next number is located on the row below, more precisely either directly below or below and one place to the right;
- the number of rows is strictly positive, but less than 100
- all numbers are positive integers between 0 and 99.

## Input

In the first line integer n - the number of test cases (equal to about 1000). Then n test cases follow. Each test case starts with the number of lines which is followed by their content.

## Output

For each test case write the determined value in a separate line.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
2
3
1
2 1
1 2 3
4
1
1 2
4 1 2
2 3 1 1
```
### Output:
```
5
9
```
