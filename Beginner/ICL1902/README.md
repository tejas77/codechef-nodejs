Problem Code: **ICL1902**

In the 2-D world of Flatland, the Circles were having their sports day and wanted to end it with a nice formation. So, they called upon Mr. Sphere from Spaceland for help. Mr Sphere decides to arrange the Circles in square formations. He starts with **_N_** Circles and forms the largest possible square using these Circles. He then takes the remaining Circles and repeats the procedure. A square of side **_S_** requires **_S^2_** Circles to create.

Find the number of squares he will be able to form at the end of the process.

## Input

- First line will contain **_T_**, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains of a single integer **_N_**.

## Output

For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of squares.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
2
85
114
```
### Output:
```
2
4
```
## Explanation

**Test case 1:** Mr Sphere forms a square of side 9 using 81 Circles and then forms a square of side 2 using the remaining 4.
