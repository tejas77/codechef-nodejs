# [A Balanced Contest](https://www.codechef.com/problems/PERFCONT)
Problem Code: **PERFCONT**

Chef wants to organize a contest. Predicting difficulty levels of the problems can be a daunting task. Chef wants his contests to be balanced in terms of difficulty levels of the problems.

Assume a contest had total **P** participants. A problem that was solved by at least half of the participants (i.e. **P / 2** (integer division)) is said to be cakewalk difficulty. A problem solved by at max **P / 10** (integer division) participants is categorized to be a hard difficulty.

Chef wants the contest to be balanced. According to him, a balanced contest must have exactly 1 cakewalk and exactly 2 hard problems. You are given the description of **N** problems and the number of participants solving those problems. Can you tell whether the contest was balanced or not?

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers, **N**, **P** denoting the number of problems, number of participants respectively.

The second line contains **N** space separated integers, **i**-th of which denotes number of participants solving the **i**-th problem.

## Output

For each test case, output "yes" or "no" (without quotes) denoting whether the contest is balanced or not.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
6
3 100
10 1 100
3 100
11 1 100
3 100
10 1 10
3 100
10 1 50
4 100
50 50 50 50
4 100
1 1 1 1
```
### Output:
```
yes
no
no
yes
no
no
```
## Explanation

**Example case 1**: The problems are of hard, hard and cakewalk difficulty. There is 1 cakewalk and 2 hard problems, so the contest is balanced.

**Example case 2**: The second problem is hard and the third is cakewalk. There is 1 cakewalk and 1 hard problem, so the contest is not balanced.

**Example case 3**: All the three problems are hard. So the contest is not balanced.

**Example case 4**: The problems are of hard, hard, cakewalk difficulty. The contest is balanced.

**Example case 5**: All the problems are cakewalk. The contest is not balanced.

**Example case 6**: All the problems are hard. The contest is not balanced.
