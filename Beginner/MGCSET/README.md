Problem Code: **MGCSET**

Katya has a sequence of integers **_a1, a2, …, an_** and an integer **_m_**.

She defines a good sequence of integers as a non-empty sequence such that the sum of the elements in each of its non-empty subsequences is divisible by **_m_**.

Katya wants to know the number of good subsequences of the sequence **_a_**. Can you help her?

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer **_T_** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **_T_** test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers **_n_** and **_m_**.
-   The second line contains **_n_** space-separated integers **_a1, a2, …, an_**.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good subsequences.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
2
2 3
1 2
2 3
1 3
```
### Output:
```
0
1
```
## Explanation

**Example case 1:** There are no good subsequences.

**Example case 2:** There is exactly one good subsequence of **a: [3]**.
