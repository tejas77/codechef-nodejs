Problem Code: **PLMU**

Chef has a sequence **_A1, A2, …, AN_**. He needs to find the number of pairs **_(i, j) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ N)_** such that **_Ai + Aj = Ai ⋅ Aj_**. However, he is busy, so he asks for your help.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer **_T_** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **_T_** test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer **_N_**.
- The second line contains **_N_** space-separated integers **_A1, A2, …, AN_**.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the desired number of pairs.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
2
3
2 4 2
3
0 2 3
```
### Output:
```
