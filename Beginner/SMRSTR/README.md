Problem Code: **SMRSTR**

Chef found a very useful open-source code for the current problem. Unfortunately, one fragment of code isn't optimized. Consider that problem: given an array **D** of size **N** and **Q** queries **X** to the following open-source code:

```
read X
for i = 1..N:
â€ƒ X = floor(X / D[i])
print X
```

Help Chef to optimize that code for all possible **X**, he will be very thankful :)

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **T** test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers - **N** and **Q**. The second line contains array **D**. The third line contains **Q** queries - **X1, X2, ..., XQ**.

## Output

For every test case in single line output **Q** integers - for each **Xi** output result for this query.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
2
2 3
2 3
5 100 8
3 2
2 2 2
16 8
```
### Output:
```
0 16 1
2 1
```
## Explanation

**Example case 1:** [[5 / 2] / 3] = 0, [[100 / 2] / 3] = 16, [[8 / 2] / 3] = 1
