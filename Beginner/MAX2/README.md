Problem Code: **MAX2**

Given a binary number (of **_N_** bits) **_X_**. Find the highest power of 2 that divides this number.

**Note:** If the binary number is "100" then the highest power of 2 that divides it is 2 (as 2^2 = 4)

## Input

- The first line contains N the number of bits in the number
- The next line contains a binary number of N bits

## Output

- The first and only line contains the max power of 2 that divides the given number

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
5
10100
