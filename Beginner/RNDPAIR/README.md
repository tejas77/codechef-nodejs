Problem Code: **RNDPAIR**

Chefu is Chef's little brother, he is 12 years old and he is new to competitive programming.

Chefu is practicing very hard to become a very skilled competitive programmer and win gold medal in IOI.

Now Chefu is participating in a contest and the problem that he is trying to solve states:

Given an array **A** of **N** integers, find any **i, j** such that **i < j** and **Ai + Aj** is maximum possible

unfortunately, there's no much time left before the end of the contest, so Chefu doesn't have time to think of correct solution, so instead, he wrote a solution that selects a random pair **(i, j) (i < j)** and output **Ai + Aj**. each pair is equiprobable to be selected.

Now Chefu wants your help to calculate the probability that his solution will pass a particular input.

## Input

First line contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test-cases.

First line of each test-case contains a single integer **N**

Second line of each test-case contains **N** space-separated integers **A1 A2 ... AN**

## Output

For each test-case output a single line containing a single number denoting the probability that Chefu's solution to output a correct answer. your answer will be accepted if the absolute difference between it and correct answer is less than 1e-6

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
3
4
3 3 3 3
6
1 1 1 2 2 2
4
1 2 2 3
```
### Output:
```
1.00000000
0.20000000
0.33333333
```
