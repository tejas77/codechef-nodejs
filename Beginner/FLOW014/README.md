# [Grade The Steel](https://www.codechef.com/problems/FLOW014)
Problem Code: **FLOW014**

A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions.
- Hardness must be greater than 50.
- Carbon content must be less than 0.7.
- Tensile strength must be greater than 5600.


The grades are as follows:
- Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met.
- Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met.
- Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met.
- Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met.
- Grade is 6 if only one condition is met.
- Grade is 5 if none of three conditions are met.

Write a program, if the user gives values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under consideration and display the grade of the steel.

## Input

The first line contains an integer **T**, total number of testcases. Then follow **T** lines, each line contains three numbers **hardness, carbon content** and **tensile strength** of the steel.

## Output

Print Grade of the steel depending on Conditions.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
3
53 0.6 5602
45 0 4500
0 0 0
```
### Output:
