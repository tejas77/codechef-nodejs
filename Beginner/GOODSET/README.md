Problem Code: **GOODSET**

A set of integers is called good if there does not exist three distinct elements a, b, c in it such that a + b = c.

Your task is simple. Just output any good set of **n** integers. All the elements in this set should be distinct and should lie between 1 and 500, both inclusive.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting number of test cases. The descriptions of **T** test cases follow.
- The only line of each test case contains an integer n, denoting the size of the needed good set.

## Output

For each test case, output a single line containing **n** integers denoting the elements of the good set, in any order. There can be more than one possible good set, and you can output any one of them.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
5
1
2
3
4
5
```
### Output:
```
7
1 2
1 2 4
1 2 4 16
3 2 15 6 10
```
## Explanation

**Example 1 and 2.** Any set of size less than or equal to 2 is good by definition.

**Example 3 onwards.** For each pair of elements in the set, you can see that their sum doesn't exist in the set.
