Problem Code: **ELEVSTRS**

Chef has been working in a restaurant which has **N** floors. He wants to minimize the time it takes him to go from the **N**-th floor to ground floor. He can either take the elevator or the stairs.

The stairs are at an angle of **45** degrees and Chef's velocity is **V1** m/s when taking the stairs down. The elevator on the other hand moves with a velocity **V2** m/s. Whenever an elevator is called, it always starts from ground floor and goes to **N**-th floor where it collects Chef (collecting takes no time), it then makes its way down to the ground floor with Chef in it.
The elevator cross a total distance equal to **N** meters when going from **N**-th floor to ground floor or vice versa, while the length of the stairs is **sqrt(2) * N** because the stairs is at angle **45** degrees.

Chef has enlisted your help to decide whether he should use stairs or the elevator to minimize his travel time. Can you help him out?

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer **T**, the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing three space-separated integers **N, V1, V2**.

## Output

For each test case, output a single line with string **Elevator** or **Stairs**, denoting the answer to the problem.
