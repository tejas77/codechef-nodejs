# [Balsa For The Three](https://www.codechef.com/problems/BFTT)
Problem Code: **BFTT**

It's well known that our friend Balsa likes the digit **3** very much. He's so obsessed with this digit that he spends time thinking about it even during holidays.

Today, Balsa invented an interesting problem: For a positive integer **_N_**, find the smallest integer greater than **_N_** such that its decimal representation contains the digit **3** at least three times.

You are given the integer **_N_**. Please solve this problem for Balsa.

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer **_T_** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **_T_** test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer **_N_**.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the smallest number greater than **_N_** containing the digit **3** at least three times.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
3
221
333
3002

### Output:
