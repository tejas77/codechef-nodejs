# [Chef and Polygon Cakes](https://www.codechef.com/problems/PCJ18C)
Problem Code: **PCJ18C**

Chef is making polygon cakes in his kitchen today!

Since the judge panel is very strict, Chef's cakes must be beautiful and have sharp and precise **_internal_** angles in arithmetic progression.

Given the number of sides, **_N_**, of the cake Chef is baking today and also the measure of its first angle(smallest angle), **_A_**, find the measure of the **_Kth_** angle.

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer **_T_**, the number of test cases.
- The next **_T_** lines contain three space separated integers **_N_**, **_A_** and **_K_**, the number of sides of polygon, the first angle and the **_Kth_** angle respectively.

## Output

For each test case, print two space separated integers **_X_** and **_Y_**, such that the **_Kth_** angle can be written in the form of **_X / Y_** and **_gcd(X,Y) = 1_**

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
1
3 30 2
```
### Output:
```
60 1
```
