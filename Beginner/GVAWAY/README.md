Problem Code: **GVAWAY**

You are given two integers **_l_** and **_r_**.
You have to choose **_k_ real** numbers in the interval **[ _l_, _r_ ]** uniform randomly.
What is the expected count of distinct numbers chosen by you?

## Input

- The first line of the input contains a single integer **_T_** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **_T_** test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers **_l_**, **_r_** and **_k_**.

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the expected count of distinct numbers chosen. It can be proved that the expected count is always an integer.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
3
3 6 4
1 3 1
6 7 2
```
### Output:
```
4
1
2
```
## Explanation

**Example case 2:** You choose only **1** real number, so it doesn't matter which real number you chose, number of distinct number is always **1**. So expected count of distinct number is **1**.
