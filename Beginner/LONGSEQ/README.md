# [Chef and digits of a number](https://www.codechef.com/problems/LONGSEQ)
Problem Code: **LONGSEQ**

Chef has a number **D** containing only digits 0's and 1's. He wants to make the number to have all the digits same. For that, he will change **exactly** one digit, i.e. from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. If it is possible to make all digits equal (either all 0's or all 1's) by flipping exactly 1 digit then output "Yes", else print "No" (quotes for clarity)

## Input

The first line will contain an integer **T** representing the number of test cases.

Each test case contain a number made of only digits 1's and 0's on newline

## Output

Print T lines with a "Yes" or a "No", depending on whether its possible to make it all 0s or 1s or not.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
2
101
11
```
### Output:
```
Yes
No
```
## Explanation

**Example case 1:** In 101, the 0 can be flipped to make it all 1.

**Example case 2:** No matter whichever digit you flip, you will not get the desired string.
