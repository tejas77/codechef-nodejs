# [Count Substrings](https://www.codechef.com/problems/CSUB)
Problem Code: **CSUB**

Given a string **S** consisting of only **1s** and **0s**, find the number of substrings which start and end both in **1**.\
In this problem, a substring is defined as a sequence of continuous characters **Si, Si+1, ..., Sj** where **1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N**.

## Input

First line contains **T**, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of **N**(the length of string) in one line and string in second line.

## Output

For each testcase, print the required answer in one line.

## Usage
```sh
node .
```
## Example
### Input:
```
2
4
1111
5
10001
```
### Output:
```
10
3
```
## Explanation

#test1: All substrings satisfy.
#test2: Three substrings S[1,1], S[5,5] and S[1,5] satisfy.
